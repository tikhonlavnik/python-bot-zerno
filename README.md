# python-bot-zerno
bot for searching farmers from db, soon i'll add functions to read and write data into google sheets by their api 
that can help user update database by adding data into sheets and bot can check updates every day

so, a few words about bot, i've used sqlite3 db 'cause i thought that i don't need to use some powerful db
sqlite is a simple in useful and a just need to read simple data like strings i dont even need to check type of vars

it's my first bot on aiogram before i had been using pytelegrambot and he hasn't async functions and it's not comfortable
i hope it's not a shame:)
